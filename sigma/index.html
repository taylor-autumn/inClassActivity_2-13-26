          <p>This is one of the three words I chose out the 9 iteration assignment 
            for part 1 of Assignment 2: Iterative Text. I was brainstorming words that 
            I thought would be good canvas's for interaction, as well as browsing fun 
            fonts to go along with them, when I came across this glitch font and got 
            the idea to make the text centered around the idea of a computer glitch. 
            For each of these iterations, I thought of ways to make the word seem like 
            an authentic computer glitch, and for ways to have their movement represent 
            this glitch.</p>
